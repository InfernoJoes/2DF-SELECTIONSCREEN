## FIGHTER SELECTION SCREEN

# a project i made to learn a little about character selection screens in various other fighting games that i've played.
# this is just an example of a fighter selection screen. it consists of a selection screen AND a fight screen, just to show off how information can be transfered through one scene to another.
# the key is to use a global script that basically takes in the data/information of the character we just selected, and uses it for something else. in this case, we only need to show off the portraits of the fighters we just selected in the selection scene, to the fight scene.

# the fight scene is not a complete 'fight scene', in the sense that it is not a fully-fledged 2d-fighter game that can be played right on the go, it only serves as an example of how things would work when we transfer/use information from our global script.

# now of course, you could make a whole game out of this. in that case, the characters that i made myself (which serve as example characters) are not copyrighted, which means you can do whatever you want with them! so long as they're not used in a boring way :)
# if you did use any of my characters from this godot project, feel free to send me the project that you've used them in! i'd love to see what kinds of stuff you all do with them!

# i'd also love to hear some feedback on what i can do better with this project!
