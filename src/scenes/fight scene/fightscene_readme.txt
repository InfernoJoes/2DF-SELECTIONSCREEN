this is the fight scene. just displays the fighters that you've selected.

now, i think i do have a couple of cool ideas that you could implement in your game, 
but these are just things you could add yourself:

- responsive movement, blocking, parrying, attacking, motion inputs and combos 
for BOTH P1 and P2 (multiplayer is a separate thing, i am not going through the hassle of implementing it)

- a health bar for the fighters and a timer that counts down from 99 seconds 
(pretty typical for old fighting games (actually NEEDED for typical old fighting games)), as well as a round system, where the first to win 2 rounds wins.

- 3 vs 3: you select three fighters, and the other also selects 3. just like in 
marvel vs capcom, capcom vs snk and skullgirls
